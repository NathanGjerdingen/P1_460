//		Yo dudes! This is Nathan. I got both these examples online here ready for 
//		the program in class. This *should* have all the functionality we need 
//		for the project. I think Example 1 is the closest, but example 2 is a little
//		more verbose. 
//		
//		So basically, we're gonna use Example 1 as the template, then find stuff in 
//		Example 2 and use it. Things that need to happen are...
//		
//		1.	Make sure you can fire these up via command line. That's how our 
//			instructor will test these things. 
//			
//		2.	Make sure all the program meets class requirements. I think there's 
//			juuuuuust one or two differences from what is accomplished in 
//			Example 1 and our programming assignment. Not only that, I believe 
//			those differences can be found in Example 2. 
//			
//		Please let me know if you guys need anything! I'll be out all night (Sat
//		Feb 16th), and will be back to work on this intermittently tomorrow.
//	
//		If you need to get ahold of me, you both have my number.
//		
//		Cheers!
